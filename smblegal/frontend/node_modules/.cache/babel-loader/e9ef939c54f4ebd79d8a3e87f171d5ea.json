We believe qualified businesses or individuals deserve more access to tools that inspire and buttress\n                 entrepreneurship and confidence in starting and running a small to medium-sized business. </p>\n\n            <p> A scholarship from SMB Legal allows qualified businesses to use our services free for one year.  This allows businesses to build efficient processes, build confidence, \n                avoid legal pitfalls and drive revenue and growth.</p>  \n\n            <p>America was built on the backs of a strong middle-class.  Small to medium-sized business ownership is a powerful entry point to the middle class, especially for underrepresented groups.  \n                Minorities own 29.3% of small businesses.  We want to help that number grow.  \n                Minority-owned small businesses have payrolls of $254 billion and receipts of $1.17 billion, respectively, representing significant minority-owned wealth. \n                We want to help that number grow. 27% of small businesses are owned by women.  We want to help that number grow.  \n                Women-owned businesses have receipts of $1.7 billion, representing immense female wealth.  We want to help that number grow.  \n                SMB Legal is committed to helping expand these numbers by providing free tools to qualified businesses.</p> \n\n            <p>Small businesses strengthen their local community’s economy.  As they succeed and prosper so does their community.  Out of every $100 spent at a small business, $68 goes back into the community.  The more businesses we can help create \n                and the more successful we can help businesses become, the more successful our entire nation will be.</p> \n\n            <p> SMB Legal is also committed to partnering with and providing a platform to public interest law groups. </p>\n            <p> If you think you are a qualified SMB Legal pro bono business, please click on the link and fill out the form.
