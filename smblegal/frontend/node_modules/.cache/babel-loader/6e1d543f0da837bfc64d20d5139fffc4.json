DESCRIPTION OF SMB LEGAL </h4>\n\n            <p> SMB Legal is an online legal portal that provides Customers with access to legal document templates and automated software to help Customers prepare \n                legal documents.  The website includes general information on commonly encountered legal issues. </p>\n                <p> SMB Legal works to keep its legal templates accurate, current and up to date. However, we cannot guarantee that all of the information is current and up to date.  \n                    Please maintain awareness that the law is different in each jurisdiction and therefore is also subject to different interpretation by courts. The legal information \n                    contained on the site is not legal advice and nor is it guaranteed to be complete or up to date.</p>\n        \n        <p> The law is personal and no general information or legal tool kit like SMB Legal is fit for any circumstance or can step in for the advice \n            of a lawyer.  Therefore, if you need specific advice for your specific \n            problem, or your specific problem is too complex you should consult an attorney.</p>\n\n            <p>SMB Legal may introduce Customers to attorneys through various methods, but at no circumstance is the performance of such a service the establishment \n                of an attorney-client relationship between the Customer and SMB Legal and it should never \n                be considered a substitute for a professional legal service or a solicitation to provide legal advice.</p> \n            \n            <br />\n            \n            <h4> 4.
