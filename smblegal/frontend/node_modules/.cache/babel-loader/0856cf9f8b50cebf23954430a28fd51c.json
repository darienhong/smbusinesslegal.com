DESCRIPTION OF SMB LEGAL </h4>\n\n            <p> SMB Legal is an online legal portal that provides Customers with access to legal document templates and automated software to help Customers prepare \n                legal documents.  The website includes general information on commonly encountered legal issues. </p>\n                <p> SMB Legal works to keep its legal templates accurate, current and up to date. However, we cannot guarantee that all of the information is current and up to date.  \n                    Please maintain awareness that the law is different in each jurisdiction and therefore is also subject to different interpretation by courts. The legal information \n                    contained on the site is not legal advice and nor is it guaranteed to be complete or up to date.</p>\n        \n        <p> The law is personal and no general information or legal tool kit like SMB Legal is fit for any circumstance or can step in for the advice \n            of a lawyer.  Therefore, if you need specific advice for your specific \n            problem, or your specific problem is too complex you should consult an attorney.</p>\n\n            <p>SMB Legal may introduce Customers to attorneys through various methods, but at no circumstance is the performance of such a service the establishment \n                of an attorney-client relationship between the Customer and SMB Legal and it should never \n                be considered a substitute for a professional legal service or a solicitation to provide legal advice.</p> \n            \n            <br />\n            \n            <h4> 4. AMENDMENT TO TERMS </h4>\n            <p> SMB Legal may amend the Terms from time to time.  Continued use of SMB Legal means that you accept and agree to any amendment of the Terms.\n            </p>\n\n            <br />\n            <h4> 5. ACCESSING SMB Legal </h4>\n            <p> Access to SMB Legal is contingent upon the creation of an account (“Account”).    The creation of an Account is to become a registered user \n                and use our service properly.  In order to create an Account, the Customer needs to provide an email address, create a password, and agree with the Terms.</p>\n\n            <br />\n\n            <h4> 6. COMMUNICATION </h4>\n            <p> By creating an Account, the Customer has assented to SMB Legal sending newsletters, marketing and promotional materials and other information.  A Customer may opt out at any time.</p>\n            <br />\n\n            <h4> 7. SUBSCRIPTIONS </h4>\n            <p> Some features on SMB Legal require the payment of fees on a subscription basis (“Subscription”).</p>\n            <p> A Customer wishing to purchase a Subscription will do so by providing valid payment via a credit card number.  By submitting a credit card number the Customer authorizes, \n                automatically, SMB Legal to charge all Subscription fees that are agreed to and incurred on your account.</p>\n            <p> The Subscription will be billed in advance and done on a monthly basis.
